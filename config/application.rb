    # framework defaults one at a time via config/initializers/new_framework_defaults_7_0.rb
    # (the Rails-sanctioned staged-upgrade pattern). We deliberately keep
    # `load_defaults 6.1` rather than flipping to 7.0 wholesale: a wholesale flip would
    # silently enable the two still-commented digest-class changes in that file
    # (`key_generator_hash_digest_class` / `hash_digest_class`), which invalidate all
    # existing encrypted cookies and cache entries -- a deployed-behavior change we are not
    # ready to make. Those get locked in only after Rails 7 is stable in production.

    # default (6.1) is deprecated under Rails 7.x and emits a boot-time deprecation warning
    # (CZID-295). Rails still reads pre-existing older-format entries; only NEW entries use
    # the 7.0 format. This app's caches are Redis (staging/prod/sandbox) or null_store
    # (dev/test), so entries simply re-populate. Per the upgrade guide this MUST be set
    # here in application.rb, not in the new_framework_defaults file.

    # deprecated in Rails 7.1 and a no-op (the implicit Array/Hash #to_s conversion
    # was already removed in Rails 7.0), so the setting did nothing but emit a
    # deprecation warning. The `load_defaults 6.1 -> 7.x` advance is separate (CZID-127).
