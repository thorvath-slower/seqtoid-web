# #544: skip wiring the live search client during `rails assets:precompile` (marked by the
# build-only ENV["ASSETS_PRECOMPILE"], set in the Dockerfile). Precompiling boots the full
# environment but never searches, so the OpensearchCircuit wrapper (app/lib) is not needed;
# skipping it keeps asset compilation independent of the search stack. ENV["ASSETS_PRECOMPILE"]
# is never set at runtime, so deployed behavior is unchanged.
# Wire the client AFTER the app is loaded. Referencing OpensearchCircuit (app/lib -- which
# itself depends on HttpResilience) directly in the initializer body raised
# `uninitialized constant OpensearchCircuit` at boot, because autoloaded app/lib constants are
# not available during initializer execution. That broke `db:migrate` (it boots the
# environment) and, via the PreSync migrate hook, blocked every deploy. `to_prepare` runs once
# the autoloader is ready (and re-runs on reload in development, so the wrapper never holds a
# stale class), which resolves the constant. Runtime behavior is otherwise unchanged.
