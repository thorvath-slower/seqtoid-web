# OpenTelemetry (#426) - vendor-neutral tracing for the web app and the Resque /
# Shoryuken workers. Spans are exported over OTLP to the in-cluster ADOT collector
# (cypherid-web-infra terraform/modules/otel-collector), which re-exports to the
# AWS-native backend (X-Ray / CloudWatch). The app stays OTLP-only so the backend can
# be swapped by editing the collector alone.
#
# This is a no-op unless OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT is set (mirrors the Sentry
# initializer's DSN gate), so local dev, tests and CI are unaffected. The endpoint is
# injected via chamber (SSM idseq-<env>-web) into every service and points at the
# collector's OTLP HTTP receiver, e.g. http://collector.<env>.otel.internal:4318.
