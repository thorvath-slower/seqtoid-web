# Cross-cutting authorization/authentication flow request specs.
#
# These pin down the app-wide auth contract that lives in ApplicationController
# (authenticate_user! + admin_required) and is easy to regress when controllers
# are refactored:
#
#   * Unauthenticated HTML requests REDIRECT to the auth0 login flow.
#   * Unauthenticated JSON requests get 401 with {errors: ['Not Authenticated']}.
#   * admin_required endpoints redirect a regular user to root_path.
#
# The format-dependent 401-vs-redirect split is exactly the kind of behavior a
# "just assert 200" test never catches. See app/controllers/application_controller.rb
# (#authenticate_user!, #admin_required) and app/controllers/users_controller.rb.
