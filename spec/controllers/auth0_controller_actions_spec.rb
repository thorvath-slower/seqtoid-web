# Coverage Wave 2 -- the two Auth0Controller actions that have no ordinary route:
#   * dev_login       -- routed ONLY in development (config/routes.rb), so it
#                        cannot be reached from a request spec in the test env.
#   * omniauth_failure -- not routed at all; invoked as a Rack action from
#                        OmniAuth's on_failure hook (config/initializers/auth0.rb).
#
# Both are exercised through an anonymous subclass of Auth0Controller. Drawing a
# route on an anonymous controller (the repo's ExportControlLayer3Gate pattern)
# keeps the temporary route scoped to this spec -- it does NOT mutate the shared
# application route table.
