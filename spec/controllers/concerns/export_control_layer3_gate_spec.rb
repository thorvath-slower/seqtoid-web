# CZID-285/286 — the Layer 3 fail-closed gate, exercised through a real before_action on an anonymous
# controller. This is the load-bearing test: it proves the DENY MATRIX (nil user / no clearance /
# verification pending/failed / screening hit/pending / stale / device-attestation-required-but-missing
# all DENY) and that the ALLOW path is reachable ONLY on an affirmative current clearance. It also proves
# the gate is INERT when the dark flag is OFF.
