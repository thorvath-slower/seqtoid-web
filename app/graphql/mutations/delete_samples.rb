module Mutations
  # Ported from the federation server (resolver-functions/DeleteSamples) as part of
  # CZID-304. Serves `DeleteSamples` natively instead of proxying POST /samples/bulk_delete.
  # Reproduces SamplesController#bulk_delete exactly: re-validate the selected ids
  # (DeletionValidationService), require all of them to be eligible, then delete via
  # BulkDeletionService -- and map {deletedIds, error} to the federation's
  # {deleted_workflow_ids, error} contract.
