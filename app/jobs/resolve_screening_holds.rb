# CZID-598 (Export-control Layer 3 / #285) -- the Descartes Incident Manager RESOLUTION poller. This is
# the async second phase of the two-phase screening model: SearchEntity (CZID-596) places a HOLD on a
# hit; a HUMAN compliance officer then adjudicates the alert in Descartes Incident Manager; this
# scheduled Resque job polls IMTimeStampSearch on an interval, pulls the verdicts back, and RELEASES or
# KEEPS-HELD each matching hold per the IM lifecycle (API design doc #595, Section 4.3).
#
# ============================ OFF-BY-DEFAULT / SELF-SKIP ============================
# perform SELF-SKIPS (returns immediately, no network, no writes) unless BOTH:
#   1. AppConfig::ENABLE_DESCARTES_SCREENING == "1" (the same flag that gates ScreeningService), AND
#   2. the ResolutionClient is configured (endpoint + credentials present in the env).
# With the flag off -- the default -- the schedule entry fires but this job is a pure no-op, so the
# feature is indistinguishable from not existing. There is NO live release path on the default config.
#
# ============================ FAIL-CLOSED ============================
# A hold is RELEASED only on an explicit terminal-clear verdict (Cleared / False Hit / CRI Auto-Clear).
# Every other status (DS New / Actioned / Escalated / True Hit / Closed / unknown) KEEPS the hold in
# force. Any transport/parse/credential error raises out of the client and is logged; the watermark is
# NOT advanced, so the same window is re-polled next run. No verdict is ever inferred from an error.
#
# ============================ IDEMPOTENT ============================
# Re-processing the same verdict is a no-op: Hold#release! keeps the first release timestamp, and
# incident_id is written only when absent. Safe to re-run over an overlapping window.
