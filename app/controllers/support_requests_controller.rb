# Sink for in-app self-help "Report an issue" submissions (Forgejo #440).
#
# Two layers, by design:
#   (A) The END USER only ever sees a minimal quick report (error / task / project
#       / account) in the popup. That arrives here as params[:quick_report].
#   (B) SUPPORT SIDE (this controller) enriches the submission into a RICH,
#       operator-only payload that the user never sees: a session/trace
#       correlation id, a best-effort "what happened and why" summary, a matched
#       runbook, and deep-links into CloudWatch Logs + the OTel dashboard filtered
#       to this user/session and time window.
#
# The enriched payload is recorded via the structured log (durable, greppable) and
# LogUtil.log_message (Sentry), "to a point" -- no external ticketing yet.
