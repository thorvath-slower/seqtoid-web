# CZID-285/286 — the Layer 3 export-control gate (identity verification + export screening, and — when
# the device-attestation policy requires it — device/location attestation).
#
# A before_action (installed on ApplicationController, AFTER authentication AND after the CZID-330
# attestation gate) that, WHEN ENFORCEMENT IS ENABLED, requires every logged-in user to hold a current,
# affirmatively-passed export-control clearance before reaching the app. This is the app-layer companion
# to the network-layer Layers 1–2 (geo/VPN) and the click-through attestation (CZID-330); it does not
# replace them — it is the deepest, true-origin layer (design doc EXPORT-CONTROL-LAYER3-DESIGN.md).
#
# FAIL-CLOSED intent (zero-tolerance): when enforcement is ON, the ONLY way past this gate is an
# affirmative current clearance — IDV verified AND screening clear. ANY other state DENIES:
#   - nil user (defense-in-depth; auth runs upstream)         => deny
#   - no clearance record                                     => deny
#   - verification pending/failed                             => deny
#   - screening pending/hit                                   => deny
#   - stale clearance version                                 => deny
#   - provider error (recorded as a non-passed row)           => deny
# There is no allow-on-uncertainty path. (Device attestation, CZID-286, is gated in the SAME fail-closed
# way but only when its policy flag requires it — see device_location_attestation_required?.)
#
# Enforcement is OFF by default (AppConfig::ENABLE_EXPORT_CONTROL_LAYER3 != "1") so this ships DARK.
# Go-live is a counsel-gated flag flip (CZID-292/278/335), never an engineering decision.
#
# TODO(counsel): the data-classification that decides WHEN a clearance is required (deemed-export scope)
# and the user-facing copy live outside this gate and are counsel-owned.
