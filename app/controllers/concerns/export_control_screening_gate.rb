# CZID-599 (Export-control Layer 3 / #285) -- the LIVE restricted-party SCREENING gate. This is the
# ticket that adds the FIRST real caller of ExportControl::ScreeningService, at the two
# counsel-recommended points (design doc #595, Section 9, Q1 = (a)+(c)):
#   - ONBOARDING backstop     -- screen the signed-in user (screen-once-and-periodic; re-running the
#                                before_action supports periodic re-screen).
#   - RESULT-RELEASE backstop -- screen before a result is released/downloaded.
#
# ================= PROVABLY INERT WHEN DISABLED (the whole point of this ticket) =================
# Every hook FIRST calls export_control_screening_gate_active?, which is false unless
# AppConfig::ENABLE_EXPORT_CONTROL_LAYER3 == "1" (the MASTER flag, default OFF). On false the hook
# EARLY-RETURNS before building any subject or even referencing ScreeningService -- a full PASS-THROUGH,
# byte-for-byte identical to the feature not existing. It is NOT "enabled but denying".
#
# Two more dark layers stack on top:
#   - the per-point toggles (ENABLE_EXPORT_CONTROL_SCREEN_ONBOARDING / _RELEASE, both default OFF): even
#     with the master flag on, a point stays a pass-through until its own toggle is on.
#   - ScreeningService#screen_if_enabled is itself gated by ENABLE_DESCARTES_SCREENING and returns nil
#     (no client, no network, no rows) when that is off -- and a nil outcome is ALSO a pass-through here.
# Triple-dark: ZERO upstream impact on the user path until counsel + the license flip all the flags.
#
# ================= FAIL-CLOSED (only once the flags are ON) =================
# When active AND screening returns a real outcome, ONLY an :allowed (clean Descartes "Passed") outcome
# proceeds. A :held (hit) or :error (transport/timeout/config/unknown) outcome BLOCKS, fail-closed: HTML
# is redirected to the clearance flow, non-HTML gets 403. There is no allow-on-uncertainty path.
