# Shared discovery-view project fetch + per-project sample_counts serialization.
#
# Extracted from ProjectsController#index (CZID-285, 303c) so the Rails REST endpoint
# (/projects.json) and the Rails-native fedWorkflowRunsAggregate resolver run the SAME
# code and return byte-identical per-project workflow counts. Behavior is unchanged for
# the controller — the logic and field shapes are preserved exactly.
#
# Hosts that include this concern must provide `current_user`, `current_power`,
# `filter_samples` (SamplesHelper), and `Project.sort_projects` / `search_by_name`.
