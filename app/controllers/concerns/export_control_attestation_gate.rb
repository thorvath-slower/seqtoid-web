# CZID-330 — the export-control / Terms-of-Use attestation gate.
#
# A before_action (installed on ApplicationController, AFTER authentication) that, WHEN ENFORCEMENT IS
# ENABLED, requires every logged-in user to have a current accepted attestation before reaching the app.
# Un-attested users are redirected to the click-through attestation page; users whose latest decision is
# "declined" get the deny UX. This is the app-layer companion to the network-layer geo/VPN enforcement
# (Layers 1-2); it does not replace them.
#
# Fail-closed intent (CZID-330): when enforcement is ON, the ONLY way past this gate is an affirmative
# current accepted attestation. Any ambiguity (no record, declined, stale version) keeps the user out.
#
# Enforcement is OFF by default (AppConfig::ENABLE_EXPORT_CONTROL_ATTESTATION != "1") so this ships DARK.
# Go-live is a counsel-gated flag flip (CZID-292/335), never an engineering decision.
#
# TODO(counsel): the attestation copy + the deny copy live in the views and are counsel-owned.
