  # CZID-280 (#237) -- local-development sign-in that does not require a live
  # Auth0 tenant. Lets a developer running truly-local (development env AND the
  # explicit ALLOW_DIRECT_USER_LOGIN=true opt-in) sign in with no Auth0 client_id
  # configured (offline), so the home -> login -> upload flow is reachable locally.
  #
  # SECURITY: This is NOT the removed /direct_user_login backdoor (CZID-319 /
  # #276). The deployed dev cluster runs the development Rails env AND is
  # internet-facing, so `Rails.env.development?` alone is NOT a sufficient gate.
  # Three independent guarantees, all requiring the ALLOW_DIRECT_USER_LOGIN=true
  # opt-in flag (set ONLY in local docker-compose, NEVER in any deployed-env
  # config), keep this inert in every deployed env:
  #   1. The route is defined ONLY inside `if Rails.env.development?` AND
  #      `if ENV["ALLOW_DIRECT_USER_LOGIN"] == "true"` in config/routes.rb, so it
  #      is absent from every deployed route table entirely (it cannot be reached
  #      there at all).
  #   2. This action re-checks `direct_login_enabled?` (dev env AND the flag) at
  #      runtime and 404s otherwise, as defense-in-depth if the action is ever
  #      reached by other means. It refuses to run unless the env is truly
  #      development and the flag is explicitly set.
  #   3. The `login` hand-off to this action is likewise gated on
  #      `direct_login_enabled?`, so with the flag off `login` falls through to
  #      the normal Auth0 redirect.
  # It also takes NO user_id parameter, so it cannot be used to "become any
  # user" -- it signs in a single fixed seeded dev user (see dev_login_user).
