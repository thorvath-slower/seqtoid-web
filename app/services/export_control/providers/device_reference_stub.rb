# CZID-286 — reference device-location provider stub (server-side token verifier). Mirrors the Layer-2
# edge reference provider: a working skeleton behind PROVIDER, NOT a committed vendor, NO live calls.
#
# It does a SHAPE-ONLY, fail-closed evaluation of the token and NEVER returns "verified": until a real
# vendor (GeoComply) verifier is wired, every attestation is treated as unverified so the gate denies. A
# real module (providers/geocomply.rb) would verify the token's cryptographic signature against the
# vendor's key, check freshness (not expired) + the anti-spoof flags, extract the coarse asserted country,
# and RAISE / return "failed" on any error.
#
# TODO(vendor): replace with the GeoComply PinPoint server-side verifier once the vendor + keys are chosen.
