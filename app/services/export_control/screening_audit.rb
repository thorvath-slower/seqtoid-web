# frozen_string_literal: true

# SMP-1253 (Export-control Layer 3 -- audit trail / diagnostic logging).
#
# The DIAGNOSTIC + CORRELATION half of the screening audit requirements. The compliance
# system-of-record stays in the DB (append-only screening_results + holds); this module
# only adds the OpenTelemetry/structured-log layer on top of those durable rows:
#   - current_trace_id: the active OTel trace id, stamped into each screening_results /
#     holds row so a compliance record cross-links to its distributed trace.
#   - record: an OTel span-attribute set + an ALWAYS-ON structured [screening_audit] log
#     line for each screening decision (allowed / held / error), so the signal exists even
#     where OTLP export is off (it lands in CloudWatch Logs, queryable for triage).
#
# Builds ON the existing OTel SDK (config/initializers/opentelemetry.rb, #426); it does NOT
# configure OTel -- when OTLP is unset the tracer is a no-op and current_trace_id is nil, so
# local/test/CI stay silent. Modeled on OtelActionLogging (CZID-472).
#
# NO-PII BY DESIGN: a screened party's name / company / address MUST NEVER reach a span or a
# log line -- only opaque identifiers (subject_ref, decision, alert_level, ids). SENSITIVE_KEYS
# is a defensive denylist so a careless future call site cannot leak PII into the audit signal.
#
# INERT-SAFE: nothing here ever raises into the screening path -- a logging failure must not
# turn an ALLOW into an error or vice-versa. The whole thing is dead code until the Descartes
# ScreeningService is enabled behind its OFF-by-default flag.
