# CZID-597 (Export-control Layer 3 / #285) -- one row per Descartes restricted-party screen of a subject.
# Append-only evidence record (see the migration). The Descartes ScreeningService (CZID-596) writes here;
# nothing writes here until that service is enabled behind its OFF-by-default flag.
#
# Two signals from a Descartes SearchEntity screen:
#   - transstatus (PRIMARY): "Passed" or "On Hold-RPS" -- Descartes' own transaction-level on-hold
#     determination. The release/hold decision keys off THIS first. Fail-closed: anything that is not
#     exactly "Passed" holds (blank / unknown / "On Hold-RPS" all hold).
#   - alert_level (SEVERITY detail): nomatch/wl/al are clean-or-allow-listed; yellow/red/double_red/
#     triple_red describe HOW BAD a match is, for the human compliance officer. Secondary to transstatus.
