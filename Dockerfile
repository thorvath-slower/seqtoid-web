# The `# syntax` line above enables BuildKit `RUN --mount=type=cache` (#463): the
# npm + bundler DOWNLOAD caches persist across local rebuilds so a Gemfile.lock /
# package-lock change re-downloads only what changed instead of the whole set.
# Build-time only — the cache dirs are NOT baked into the image (installed gems in
# /usr/local/bundle/gems + node_modules ARE). Needs DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 (the Makefile
# and buildx set it). In CI the mounts are empty per run (harmless); the win is local.
# =============================================================================
# Multi-stage build (EOL image hardening, #251-255/#346): compile everything in a
# full-toolchain `builder` stage, then ship a slim `runtime` stage carrying ONLY
# the runtime deps + built artifacts. Drops build-essential, all `-dev` headers,
# the C/C++ toolchain, and node from the shipped image — the bulk of the Trivy
# HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs (the ~1354 came from the full Debian base + build packages).
#
# Both stages are Debian bookworm on ruby 3.3.6, so the gems + python extensions
# compiled in `builder` are ABI-compatible when copied into `runtime`.
#
# WARNING: RUNTIME NOT YET VALIDATED end-to-end (the container booting + serving) —
# that needs a dev smoke once the EKS/Argo dev cluster is up. This pass proves the
# build assembles and the CVE count drops; runtime acceptance is the follow-up gate.

# #544: Precompile the Sprockets assets (application.css et al.) into public/assets so the
# runtime image ships them. prod.rb has config.assets.compile off (the on-the-fly fallback is
# disabled), so without precompiled assets the server-rendered landing page 500s with
# Sprockets::Rails::Helper::AssetNotPrecompiledError (HomeController#landing). This runs AFTER
# `npm run build-img`, so the webpack dist bundles that application.css `//= require`s exist.
#
# Boot env for the precompile:
#  - RAILS_ENV=prod : the strict deployed env whose config.assets.compile is off and therefore
#    REQUIRES precompiled assets. The one image is promoted to every tier, and the Sprockets
#    manifest written under public/assets is read env-agnostically at serve time, so the
#    dev/staging/sandbox tiers (RAILS_ENV=development/staging/sandbox, per bin/deploy) serve the
#    same precompiled assets. NOT `production` -- this app has no `production` DB config (envs:
#    development/deployed/prod/staging/sandbox), which is exactly why the earlier attempt (#204)
#    died with ActiveRecord::AdapterNotSpecified before precompiling anything.
#  - assets:precompile is a rake task, so Rails forces config.eager_load=false regardless of
#    prod.rb -- no app models are loaded, so no boot-time DB connection is attempted.
#  - DATABASE_URL : a dummy, parseable URL so the DB config resolves without the real
#    RDS_ADDRESS/DB_* env vars; precompile is lazy and never opens the connection.
#  - SECRET_KEY_BASE : prod.rb reads ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"] directly; a dummy value satisfies
#    boot without baking a real secret into the build.

#  - samtools shared libs (libncurses/libbz2/liblzma/zlib/libcurl/libdeflate).
#  - libmariadb3: the mysql2 gem's native ext links libmysqlclient (built against
#    default-libmysqlclient-dev = libmariadb-dev in builder). Already multi-arch.
#  - python3 runtime (the app shells out to python/awscli; awscli is pure-python pip,

#
# #482 MySQL-client per-arch caveat: Oracle's MySQL-community APT repo ships amd64 ONLY
# (there is NO arm64 build of mysql-community-client anywhere in repo.mysql.com's pool).

#    regression; deliberately non-MariaDB for MySQL-8 virtual-generated-column import
#    compat — see the original single-stage note).
#  - arm64: fall back to Debian's default-mysql-client (MariaDB) so arm64 pods have the
#    `mysql`/`mysqlimport` binaries and can boot + serve. CAVEAT: the MariaDB `mysqlimport`
#    is what the community client was chosen to AVOID for the index-gen rake's virtual-
#    generated-column import — so the taxon-index-gen rake (update_tables_for_index_gen)
#    must keep running on an AMD64 node until that import path is validated on MariaDB.
#    The web/request path does NOT use these binaries (it uses the mysql2 gem →
#    libmariadb3, already multi-arch), so arm64 web pods are unaffected.

# privileged port), so nothing here needs root at runtime. We create appuser with a FIXED
# uid/gid 10001 (stable, reproducible ownership across rebuilds) and hand it ownership of the
# only paths Rails must write at runtime:
